Netflix Data Analysis
What is this project?
This project analyzes 8,800+ movies and TV shows on Netflix to find trends in content. I used Python to clean the data and create charts that show what Netflix is focusing on.

What did I find?
Movies vs TV Shows: Netflix has more movies (70%) than TV shows (30%).

Growth: The number of shows added every year has increased a lot since 2015.

Top Genres: International Movies and Dramas are the most popular categories.

Tools Used
VS Code (for writing code).

Pandas (for cleaning messy data).

Seaborn & Matplotlib (for making the charts).
